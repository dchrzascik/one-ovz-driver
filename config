DOMAIN = 'user@host'

# If you want to run integration tests, you must copy/download the driver to/on
# the openvz host to REMOT_DIRECTORY. Then, you can synchronise source code and
# run all the tests from another machine by invoking in the main directory:
# $ rake remote_test
# This will cause source synchronisation (via rsync) and run tests (via ssh) at
# DOMAIN:REMOTE_DIR
